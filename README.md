# Radioactive decay calculator
Hello!

This is a small tool, for visualizing the decay of various radioactive isotopes against time.
The tool uses the exponential decay model and numerical integration for calculating the products
along the decay chain. This is how it looks:

## Project status
The tool is currently in development, but the core is already functional.

## Todos:
* Implement adding and editing isotopes for the database.
* Implement raw data exporting.
* Implement graph tools (set limits, units, etc.)
* Implement calculation for activity

## Use
The tool can be cloned, and started with the _run_main.bat file (for convenience), or with the main.py directly.
