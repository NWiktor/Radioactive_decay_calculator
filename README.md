# Radioactive decay calculator
Hello!

This is a small tool, for visualizing the decay of various radioactive isotopes against time.
The tool uses the exponential decay model and numerical integration for calculating the products
along the decay chain.

## Project status
The tool is currently in development, but the core is already functional.

## Todos:
* Implement adding and editing isotopes for the database.
* Implement raw data exporting.
* Implement graph tools (set limits, units, etc.)
* Implement calculation for activity

## Use
The tool can be cloned, and started with the _run_main.bat file (for convenience), or with the main.py directly.
