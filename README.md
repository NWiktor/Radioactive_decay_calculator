# Radioactive decay calculator
Hello!

This is a small tool, for visualizing the decay of various radioactive isotopes against time.
The tool uses the exponential decay model and numerical integration for calculating the products
along the decay chain. This is how it looks:

## Project status
The tool is currently in development, but the core is already functional.

## Todos
* Populate database
* Improve input validation and input error handling
* Settings for stop isotope (where the decay chain calculation stops).
* Add option to normalize and visualize decay product yield (0-100 % mass).
* Implement raw data exporting.
* Implement more graph options (set limits, units, etc)
* Implement calculation for activity.

## Use
The tool can be cloned, and started with the _run_main.bat file (for convenience), or with the main.py directly.
